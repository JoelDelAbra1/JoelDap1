## Objective üèπ

This program has the main objective of helping the person calculate some of the most important taxes paid in Mexico, such as ISR and IVA, which are present in most of the lives of those who pay taxes in the country. In the same way, inform the population about what these taxes are and thus have a healthier financial life, since a large number of people of legal age don't know them or their knowledge of these are very few and this has been a problem that has been maintained and is constantly growing.

## The taxes that the program will calculate üè¶üè¶
- ISR
- IVA
- IESP- Gasoline
- IDE
- ISAN

## Most important taxes

### ISR üë®‚Äçüíº


Income Tax ( ISR in Spanish ) is a direct tax charge that is applied to the income obtained that increases the patrimony of a taxpayer,
Therefore, individuals and legal entities (companies) are obliged to pay this tax.

According to the Income Tax Law ( LISR in Spanish ), payment is required to people who:

* Reside in Mexico.
* Live abroad with an establishment in the country.
* Residents abroad who receive income from sources of wealth in Mexico.

#### How is it calculated? ‚öñÔ∏è

The Total Taxable amount of the Payroll is considered, the calculation is as follows:

1. The total amount is located within the corresponding range in the table.
2. The total amount minus the lower limit is subtracted.
3. The corresponding percentage is applied to the result.
4. To the result, the corresponding fixed fee is added.

### IVA ü§ë

The Value Added Tax ( IVA in Spanish ) is a tax that has been applied in Mexico since 1978. This tax is charged to goods and services. Currently, it is equivalent to 16% in most of the country, while it is equivalent to 8% at the border.

IVA is an indirect tax, which means that instead of being applied directly to taxpayers' income (as is the case with ISR), it is applied to the consumption or enjoyment of goods or services. More specifically, according to article 1 of the "IVA" Law, this tax applies to the sale of goods, the provision of independent services, the granting of temporary use of goods, and the importation of goods and services.
